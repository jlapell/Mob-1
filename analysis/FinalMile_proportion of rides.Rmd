NOTE: 
1.the following several code chunks are copied directly from FinalMileOriginal.Rmd and FinalMile_Stations.Rmd(which is from Yankee).
2. In order not to confuse the source of the data, the variable names were defined differently so that the bikeshare station and the metro station could be clearly distinguished.

Define the Haversine distance function so we can compute distance between things
```{r}
# This function takes five arguments:
# 
# Longitude and latitude of the first location
# Longitude and latitude of the second location
# A parameter by which to round the responses

haversine <- function(long1, lat1, long2, lat2, round = 3) {
  # convert to radians
  long1 = long1 * pi / 180
  lat1  = lat1  * pi / 180
  long2 = long2 * pi / 180
  lat2  = lat2  * pi / 180
  
  R = 6371 # Earth mean radius in km
  
  a = sin((lat2 - lat1)/2)^2 + cos(lat1) * cos(lat2) * sin((long2 - long1)/2)^2
  d = R * 2 * asin(sqrt(a))
  
  return( round(d,round) ) # distance in km
}
```

Just doing a sample for a Monday, this is for September 5, 2022, the first Monday of the month.
```{r}
bikeshare1 = bikeshare %>% select(ride_id, slat = start_lat, slng = start_lng) %>% na.omit() 
#end_station_name -> end_metro_staion_name
metro_stations1 = metro_stations %>% select(end_metro_station_name = name, lat = y, lng = x) %>% na.omit()
```

https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58831578/minimum-distance-between-lat-long-across-multiple-data-frames
Finds the closest metro station to bikes endpoint, adds metro station name and distance to the bikshare dataframe.
```{r}
#calculate the distance matrix
distmatrix<-distm(bikeshare1[, c(3, 2)], metro_stations1[,c(3, 2)])
#find closest column and get distance
closest<-apply(distmatrix, 1, which.min)
bikeshare1$close_station <- as.character(metro_stations1$end_metro_station_name[closest])
bikeshare1$distance <- apply(distmatrix, 1, min)/1000
```

Counts the amount of bikes parked within 0.1524/500ft, close enough to consider bike being used for final mile.
```{r}
final_mile = bikeshare1 %>% filter(distance < 0.1524) 
bikeshare_end = bikeshare %>% select(ride_id, elat = end_lat, elng = end_lng)
new = left_join(final_mile, bikeshare_end, by = "ride_id")
```

```{r}
final_mile1 = new %>% mutate(start_to_end = haversine(slng, slat, elng, elat))
final_mile1 = final_mile1 %>% filter(start_to_end <= 1.60934 & start_to_end != 0) %>% select(ride_id, close_station, distance, start_to_end)
```

Make the data frames that we'll use for analysis.
```{r}
final_mile1_grouped = final_mile1 %>% group_by(close_station) %>% 
  summarise(count = n(), avg_distance_to_bikeshare = mean(distance), 
            avg_ride_distance = mean(start_to_end))
```

New analyze start
Goal : Calculate proportion of rides within 500 ft of a station that are final mile rides

Get a ride which rides are not limited by 1 mile (original data) and group by close station, make a one data frame.
```{r}
final_mile2 = new %>% mutate(start_to_end = haversine(slng, slat, elng, elat))
final_mile2 = final_mile2 %>% filter(start_to_end != 0) %>% select(ride_id, close_station, distance, start_to_end)
final_mile2_grouped = final_mile2 %>% group_by(close_station) %>% 
  summarise(count = n(), avg_distance_to_bikeshare = mean(distance), 
            avg_ride_distance = mean(start_to_end))
final_mile3 = inner_join(final_mile1_grouped, final_mile2_grouped, by="close_station")
final_mile3 <- final_mile3 %>% mutate(proportion = count.x/count.y)
```

Visualize for the proportion of final mile rides which is less than 1 mile grouped by close station
```{r}
final_mile3 %>% ggplot(aes(x=reorder(close_station,-proportion))) + 
  geom_bar(aes(weight=proportion)) +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, vjust = 0.5, hjust=1)) +
  labs(title = "the proportion of final mile rides which is less than 1 mile", 
       x = "Metro Station", 
       y = "Proportion of Final Mile Rides",
       caption = "Sample of bikeshare data is from September 2022.") +
  scale_x_discrete(label = function(x) stringr::str_trunc(x, 20))
```
